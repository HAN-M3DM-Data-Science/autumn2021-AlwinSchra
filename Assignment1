# Why was data driven decision making (3DM) useful in this business case?

Schiphol is one of the biggest, and one of the most innovative, airports in Europe and it is constantly improving itâ€™s processes. Nowadays they are very busy with implementing new technologies in their daily activities and therefore they gather lots of data. With these data they can further improve their processes, and so on.. Through the available data the Data Scientists at Schiphol can analyze the current processes within the airport and then analyze if there are ways to improve the actual process. By improving is meant that it takes less time to fulfill the same activity, or by being able to better guarantee safety around the airport, or by reducing costs, and so on.
